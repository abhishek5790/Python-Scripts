# Factorial program to find the factorial number which is 1 * 2 * 3 * n 

# To take input from the user, use input function , num is a variable 
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# factorial is a variable to store the final output , it is assigned with 1 initially

# else if condition to check if the number is zero

elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")

# else if the number is greater than 0, then find the factorial value
